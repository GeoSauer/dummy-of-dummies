## What is FOR(DUMMYOFDUMMIES)?

Along our personal journeys to become software developers we all noticed that, while some websites are absolutely stacked and overflowing with helpful information, they can also be overflowing with people not exactly thrilled to share information with those new to coding. We can't weed out all the bad eggs, but we aimed to create a space with the newer devs in mind that is geared specifically towards beginner questions and patient advice.

## How it Works

-   Auth page where new members can sign up or existing members can sign in
-   A terms of service outlining the rules and atmosphere of the page that must be agreed to in order to become a member
-   Create a profile in order to view and create questions and comments
-   A full list of member-asked questions that can be sorted by keyword and/or specific category
-   Users can 'like' questions that they want to keep track of for later viewing
-   User can add and view comments on each question in realtime to easily collaborate
